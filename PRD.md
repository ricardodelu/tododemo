🎯 Project Brief
Project Name: Java Blog Backend Demo  
Session Date: July 21, 2025  
Estimated Time: 1-2 days  
AI Assistant: GitHub Copilot

📋 Quick Overview
What am I building?  
A minimal Java backend REST API for blog posts, to test Railway’s deployment and managed PostgreSQL database.

Why am I building it?
- Learning new technology (Railway, Java backend deployment)
- Experiment/prototype for future projects

Success looks like:  
The API is deployed on Railway, connected to a Railway-managed PostgreSQL DB, and all endpoints work as expected.

🎪 Core Features (MVP)
Must have today:
- Create a blog post (title, content, author, timestamp)
- Retrieve all blog posts
- Retrieve a single blog post by ID
- Delete a blog post by ID

Nice to have if time allows:
- Update a blog post
- Basic input validation

Definitely NOT doing:
- User authentication
- Comments, tags, categories
- Frontend UI

🛠 Tech Stack
Frontend: None  
Backend: Java (Spring Boot)  
Database: PostgreSQL (Railway managed)  
Deployment: Railway  
Key Libraries: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL JDBC Driver  
Why this stack?  
Spring Boot is familiar and fast for REST APIs; Railway offers easy deployment and managed DBs.

👤 User Stories (Top 3)
- As a developer, I want to create blog posts so I can test API write operations.
- As a developer, I want to fetch all blog posts so I can verify data retrieval.
- As a developer, I want to delete blog posts so I can test API delete operations.

🗂 API Design (If applicable)
Core Endpoints:
- GET /posts - List all blog posts
- POST /posts - Create a new blog post
- GET /posts/{id} - Get a single blog post by ID
- DELETE /posts/{id} - Delete a blog post by ID

Data Models:
Post {
  id: Long
  title: String
  content: String
  author: String
  createdAt: Timestamp
}

📱 UI/UX Notes
Pages/Views needed:  
None (API only)

Key user flows:  
Developer sends HTTP requests → API processes request → Developer receives JSON response

Design inspiration/style:  
Minimal, RESTful

🏗 Development Plan
Session 1 (Today)
- Set up project structure
- Implement Post entity, repository, controller
- Configure PostgreSQL connection
- Deploy/test basic version on Railway

If continuing...
- Add update endpoint
- Add input validation

🚨 Blockers & Questions
Things I need to figure out:
- How to configure Railway DB credentials in Spring Boot
- How to expose the correct port for Railway

AI Assistant help needed:
- Code generation for CRUD endpoints
- Debugging DB connection issues
- Architecture advice for deployment

📊 Definition of Done
MVP Complete when:
- CRUD endpoints for blog posts work
- Deployed and accessible on Railway
- Basic error handling in place
- Can demo in 2 minutes

Quality checks:
- No console errors
- Basic validation/error states
- API returns correct status codes
